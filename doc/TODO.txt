
TODO list
~~~~~~~~~~


* PrintWriter instead of System.out - to be able to redirect the output 
  for analysis (in unit tests, for example). log4j as an option?

* FTDNA native format (CSV, fasta) convertor

* GenBank convertor

* HapMap convertor

* order, cleaning

* raw2ped convertor (a doc/help, maybe some more reasonable defaults)
