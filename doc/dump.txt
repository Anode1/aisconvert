Usage:
     aisconvert --input 1.txt
                     Process on file
     aisconvert -i 1.txt
                     The same as previous but shorter
     aisconvert 1.txt
                     The shortest way to pass file
     aisconvert "Some Directory"
                     All files in passed directory will be processed
     aisconvert -i /home/vasya/file1.txt -i /home/pasha/file2.txt -i All
                     Passing list of files (mixing files and directories allowed
)
     aisconvert -i 1.txt --snips data/snips.txt
                     Passing required snips (If snips are not passed - there
                     will be a warning and default snips file will be used
     aisconvert -u -i 1.txt -i 2.txt
                     HIR calculator: compare 2 files
