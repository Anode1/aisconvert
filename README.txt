A Toolkit for processing genetic data. Currently supports (command-line): phasing, Half-IBD (Identity by descent) 
aka HIRs - between 2 or any number of files (in distances and cM); RAW2PED, PED2RAW conversions; regions of homozygousity 
and other converters.

At the moment GUI version supports only a few tools which are available from the command line 


====================================================================================================
Installation:

Unzip aisconvert distribution (it will create "aisconvert" directory). 

Currently all the tools are working from command-line (and only a couple of simple functions supported in GUI).

Under windows:
For GUI version - double-click on aisconvert-gui.bat

Or better use command-line version: 
 
Run -> cmd -> 
 C:\> cd aisconvert
 C:\aisconvert> aisconvert --help

Under Unix/Linux - run
 $ sh ./aisconvert --help
 $ sh ./aisconvert-gui
